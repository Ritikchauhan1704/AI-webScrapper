# AI Web Scraper

**Under Construction** 

An intelligent web scraping tool built with Go that leverages AI to extract and process web content efficiently.

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development. The basic structure is in place, but core functionality is still being implemented.

## Current Structure

```

├── app/
│   └── main.go          # Main application entry point
├── go.mod               # Go module dependencies
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Planned Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Content Extraction** - Intelligent parsing of web pages using machine learning
- 🌐 **Multi-Site Support** - Scrape data from various websites with different structures
- ⚡ **Concurrent Processing** - Fast, parallel processing of multiple URLs
- 📊 **Data Export** - Export scraped data in JSON, CSV, and XML formats
- 🔄 **Rate Limiting** - Respectful scraping with configurable delays
- 🛡️ **Anti-Detection** - Smart user-agent rotation and request headers
- 📈 **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress monitoring and logging
- 🔧 **Configuration** - Flexible YAML/JSON configuration files
